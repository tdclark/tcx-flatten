# tcx-flatten

## Purpose
tcx-flatten can be used to flatten a set of TCX files
(such as those downloaded from [garmin-connect-export](https://github.com/kjkjava/garmin-connect-export))
into a single, flat JSON file of GPS locations including
latitude, longitude, and altitude if available.

The goal of this is to eventually be able to produce
heatmaps from a dump of Garmin Connect activities.
